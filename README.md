# Running the game

Chess Master Express XD must be run using a compiler such as Eclipse or Dr. Java. The game is started by running the "ChessGame.java" class.

## ChessMaster
Chess Master Express XD was a group project for ICS4U1. It is a chess game built from the ground up that was coded in java. This project utilized the intense understanding of Chess' logic in order to recreate a chess-like expierence for the user. This project used the Graphics2D class in order to display all the graphics used within this project.

The game is unlike conventional chess, two teams of two play against each other in attempt to checkmate their opponents across 2 chessboards. Each team consists of a white and black player, and whenever a player takes an opponents piece his teammate can have the opportunity to use that piece in his own set by replacing one of his own pieces with the other piece. 

Despite this, Chess Master Express XD contains most all the conventions you would expect to find in a normal chess game. When a piece is selected, all legal moves are highlighted in blue so that players can easily identify their next move. It is not possible to make illegal moves, such as moving pieces in an illegal manner. Pinned pieces cannot make illegal moves. Pieces in check are unable to move illegaly. Players can make legal castles and replace their pawn with a piece of their choosing upon getting their pawn to the furthest row of the  opponents side. Checkmate occurs when a player has no legal moves. Unfortunately, due to time constrictions, en passant and stalemate were not implemented.
